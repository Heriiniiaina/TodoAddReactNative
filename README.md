Here’s a template to start a project with React Native, Expo, and TypeScript.

Project Overview
This is an Expo project created with create-expo-app.

Getting Started
Install dependencies

Run the following command to install necessary packages:

bash
Copier le code
npm install
Start the app

Use this command to launch the app:

bash
Copier le code
npx expo start
Once started, you’ll find options in the output to open the app in a:

Development build
Android emulator
iOS simulator
Expo Go, a sandbox for testing app development with Expo
You can start developing by editing the files inside the app directory. This project uses file-based routing.

This will move the starter code to the app-example directory and create a blank app directory to start your development from scratch.
